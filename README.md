### Building Multi Tenant Applications with Django


This project is a multi-tenant web application built using the Django framework. The goal is to create a scalable application where multiple tenants (organizations or users) can use the same infrastructure while keeping their data isolated.

# Features

### Multi-Tenant Support:
Supports multiple tenants in a single application with isolated databases or schema per tenant.

### Django ORM Integration: 
Leverages Django’s ORM for database operations with tenant-specific queries.
### Tenant Routing: 
Routes users to their tenant-specific environment based on the domain or subdomain.
### Tenant Middleware: 
Middleware to automatically resolve the current tenant based on the request.
### Admin Panel: 
Central admin panel for managing tenants and tenant-specific data.
### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 
User roles and permissions are tenant-specific, ensuring data security.

### Technologies
* Django (version 3.2 or higher)
* Django-Tenants or Django-Schema (for multi-tenancy management)
* PostgreSQL (or any other supported relational database)
* Django Rest Framework (optional, if building an API)
* Redis (optional, for caching)

### Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you’ll need:

* Python 3.8 or higher
* PostgreSQL (or any supported relational database)
* A virtual environment (optional but recommended)
* Redis (optional, if using caching)

### Customization
* Tenant Routing: Modify the tenant identification logic to suit your application (e.g., subdomains vs. domain routing).
* Schema Management: Configure how tenant schemas are created or updated when new tenants are added.
* Tenant-Aware Queries: Ensure tenant-specific queries are handled correctly by using the provided database router.
